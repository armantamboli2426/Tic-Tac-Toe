# Tic-Tac-Toe
It is a simple tic tac toe game made by me as a my 1st javascript project.
This code allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid and checks for a winner based on certain winning patterns.
It initializes variables and selects DOM elements using querySelector and querySelectorAll.
It defines the winning patterns for tic-tac-toe.
It defines a function resetgame to reset the game state.
It adds click event listeners to each box, allowing players to mark their moves alternately ('o' and 'x').
It defines functions to enable boxes, show the winner, and check for a winner after each move.
It adds event listeners to the reset button and a new game button to reset the game.
